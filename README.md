House Price Prediction Project 

 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The model will assist real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers in making informed decisions about property values.

 Problem Statement
House prices are influenced by numerous factors (location, size, amenities, etc.), making manual estimation complex and error-prone. This project uses machine learning to automate and improve the accuracy of house price predictions.

Dataset
- Kaggle's Advanced Housing Price Dataset
- Features: Includes numeric (square footage, year built) and categorical (neighborhood, condition) variables
- Target Variable: Sale Price of houses

 Technical Setup
- Language: Python 3.13.2
- Environment Management: pipenv
- Version Control: Git/GitHub
- Cloud Services: AWS (planned)
- Key Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
